Many Christians believe that Jesus was both fully human and fully divine (the Son of God), fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah 7:14 and being the Messiah prophesied by the Hebrew prophets.\n\nThis belief is based on several key biblical passages:\n\n1. **Matthew 1:23**: \"And he shall be called a Nazarene; for he shall stand up from his father's house in Israel, and shall shew judgment unto the people, and shall be a light unto the Gentiles, and kings shall kiss him.\"\n2. **John 1:18**: \"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten God which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.\"\n\nThese verses indicate that Jesus was conceived through the Holy Spirit and born of",
